# drawgame

## This application is designed to be played as a multiplayer game built into the web browser. Players will go through multiple rounds trying to guess what the current painter is drawing.
## The game works off a round-based system using a custom-built timer and using the DOM to update the page in realtime.
## Once a correct guess is made from a player, the painter and the guesser will receive points according to how much time has passed.
## Once all the rounds have been completed the game will end and a new game will start automatically.
